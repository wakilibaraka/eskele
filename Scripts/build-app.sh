# Signing identity decides whether macOS remembers this app between builds.
#
# An ad-hoc signature's designated requirement is the binary's own cdhash, so every rebuild is a
# *different application* as far as TCC is concerned — permissions granted in System Settings stop
# applying the moment you rebuild. Any real certificate gives a requirement based on the identifier
# and the leaf certificate instead, which survives rebuilding.
#
# Apple Development first. The two kinds make different requirements — Apple Development names the
# certificate, Developer ID the team — so a Mac holding both would otherwise sign with whichever
# `find-identity` happened to list first, and a build that switched would lose its grants just the
# same. Developer ID is the fallback for a machine with nothing else, such as the release runner;
# package.sh re-signs with it either way.
