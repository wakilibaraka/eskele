# Changelog

Everything notable that changed in the app. The website and its documentation are not the app, so
they are not here; what a release changed about Eskele itself is.

Each version's section below is what the release workflow publishes: it becomes the GitHub release's
description and the release notes Eskele shows in its own update window, so it is written for
someone deciding whether to install it.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- The **minimum system is macOS 13**, down from 14: the settings store and every preferences pane
  have moved off the macOS 14 Observation framework onto Combine, so Eskele runs one system
  generation further back.

### Fixed

- The build, which the porting work had left broken. Both committed heads failed to compile: the
  launcher port removed the old launcher while still calling it from the app delegate, and the
  Features pane asked the update stub for members it never had. The app delegate now drives the
  ported Launchpick launcher, the update service answers every call its settings surface makes, and
  the actor-isolation and availability errors that followed are resolved.
- Ported pieces that were lost in transit are back: the bluetooth icon, the launcher blacklist and
  style, and the pure search and grouping logic the launcher lists and the tests still pin.
- macOS 14-only system calls — window activation, the quadratic bezier, menu section headers,
  EventKit full access, and ScreenCaptureKit screenshots — are availability-gated with macOS 13
  equivalents, so nothing the port shipped disappears on the older system.
- The launcher, calendar and flyout strings from the port are in the English catalogue, and the
  six catalogue entries the old launcher left behind are gone, so the localization contract tests
  hold again.

### Added

- The launch keys now work on macOS 13 through availability shims, and the localization scanner no
  longer mistakes SF Symbol names and selector literals for translatable copy.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-09-28

### Changed

- On the application you are using, the **window you are on** gets a long, bright running dash and
  its other windows shrink to dots, so an application with three windows shows which of the three
  you are on. Applications in the background keep their even row of dashes.
- The **hover label appears the moment the pointer reaches a cell**, as the system Dock's does. With
  Reserve Screen Space on, the Dock parked under the bar used to name whichever of its own icons
  was underneath first, so for a moment the label could read Finder over Visual Studio Code. The
  window preview still waits until the pointer rests.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-23

### Changed

- Eskele now points at its own home, `eskele.app`: the **Website** link in the About panel, and the
  address `--diagnose` prints beside a permissions warning.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-22

The first release.

### Added

- A bar along the **left, bottom or right** screen edge, one menu-bar thickness, in two scales and up
  to five rows — columns, on a side bar. It either fits its icons or spans the edge, with icon-only
  or labelled items.
- **Three designs** — Dock, Classic and Unity — each a click, and a Custom tile that keeps whatever
  you changed afterwards, so trying another one is not losing yours.
- **Hiding the system Dock** while Eskele runs: the Dock's own preferences are backed up first and
  put back when Eskele quits, `make restore-dock` recovers even with the app deleted, and reserved
  screen space stops maximised windows short of the bar.
- **Running applications** with one dash per window, window lists and titles from Accessibility, and
  clicks that launch, activate, cycle windows or hide — plus a button per window in full-width mode.
- **Pinned applications, files and folders**: drag to reorder, drag off to unpin, drop files on an app
  to open them with it, folder stacks that list their contents, a Trash that takes drops and asks
  before emptying, and an *Add to Eskele* item in Finder's Services menu.
- **The Apps Menu**, a searchable launcher over your favourites, every application by category, or
  the recent ones, with Sleep, Log Out, Restart and Shut Down, and a gear into Settings.
- **What a cell can tell you**: badges from the Dock's own tiles and from commands of your own,
  progress bars for file operations and for anything else you can script, an activity overlay for
  processor and memory while a modifier is held, and a highlight for an app asking for attention.
- **A clock** with a choice of faces, **custom icons and names** per item, and **multi-display**
  support with a bar per screen.
- **Auto-hide** with a global reveal key, a choice of what the bar does inside a full-screen space,
  hot keys for the first nine slots, keyboard access with ⌃⌥⇥, and VoiceOver labels, values and
  actions on every cell.
- **A settings window** of five panes, with export, import and reset, launch at login, and a
  first-run choice of how Eskele should treat the Dock.
- **Opt-in updates**: Eskele never checks until you ask it to, and checks nothing about you when it
  does. Every update is verified against a key built into the copy you are running.
- **English throughout, translatable everywhere**: every string is in a catalogue the test suite
  checks against the source, so a second language is a directory away.
